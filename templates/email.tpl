If showing Email messages, then this is a table of messages, organized 
(perhaps) by thread, where each row is an email message and columns
show things like Sender, To, CC, date, names of aMachments, etc. 
Message detail brings up a dismissable window; other items bring up the 
appropriate data type tab (Documents or People) with the appropriate 
detail view selected.
